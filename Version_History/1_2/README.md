# PLEASE NOTE

(October 2, 2025)

An error was discovered in the calculation of these census crosswalk files that affected roughly 4% of census blocks. Where census blocks intersected more than one community water system, the building weight was incorrectly calculated to be too low. This error has been corrected in the files available here. If you need to use the version 1.2 data, be sure you re-download the census crosswalk tables.
