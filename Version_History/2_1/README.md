## Version 2.1 Update

Version 2.1 includes the addition of 875 service areas that were previously modeled but are now based on system sourced data (see 'New_System_Sourced_V_2_1.csv').
We have also updated the Census crosswalk tables. A previous error was found where slivers of building footprints were missing from the crosswalk files, which resulted in some service areas being excluded from the crosswalks. This error has been corrected.
